Day3 :

1. Prepare code base for Rasberry pi on linux host  - done 
2. Understand GPIO  - done 
3. implement Char drv for GPIO --- done
4. implemented user space code  to test GPIO .  -- done 
5. ARM aRCH  ch 1, ch2 completed 



1.  try to implement user space code 
 open should call and open the driver  /dev/mygpio_drv
request gpio
set direction



in  write you have to set  the gpio pin   

In read we have to read gpio pin (gpio_read)


in close you have to close the driver 


2. so far you have usring existing zimage for testing 

3. use your base zimage and load it in target board  --today

4. compile your driver in your local machine or implement the code in pi  board  

5. sudo insmod your driver name 
6. lsmod check the driver 
7. dmesg check the logs 

8 implement usespace code
